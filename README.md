neoga.fun:Neo Yoga for fun
==========================
Come join me in our Public Library in Ramsey, NJ

We will have fun

## On Saturday 11:00 AM EST - November 20th, 2021
 
 The world needs a New Yoga. The Yoga we have now in 2021 deals hugely with human breathing, also  deals with poses all connected to Earth and gravity. My neoga added a third dimension to that PLANET EARTH BREATHING and syncing your breathing with hers.
 
We reached a stage if we continue using fossil fuel, coal and gas (make total 80% of global energy usage in 2016) in our lifetime planet earth will not be inhabitable.


Our president Biden in Glasgow 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in his political presentation mentioned fossil fuel, coal and Hydrogen, if I were there, I’ll stopped him saying you meant Gas he may answer me “Kiddo, Hydrogen is a gas” I will keep my mouth shut and smile, at the end he is my president. If you think that our president said Hydrogen accidentally  my advice to you to watch Kung Fu panda movie, wise turtle there said there is no accident, actually Hydrogen fuel is the most viable solution to our CO2 emissions caused by the three fuel types mentioned above, demonstrated in ITER project in south France, and politician do not like to talk about it, the same moral when politicians talk about drinking and driving, and sleeping behind the wheel=SBTW, huge penalties to DUI and silent to SBTW like a patriot POW not talking about his nation secrets
Politicians do not talk about Hydrogen as there are no guaranty of succeeding of replacing the three fuels.

neoga will teach participant how to contribute to save the environment while having fun
